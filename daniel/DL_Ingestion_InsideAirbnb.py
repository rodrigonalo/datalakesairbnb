# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC This code processes a list of URLs pointing to .gz compressed CSV files, decompresses them, and uploads the decompressed CSV data to Azure Blob Storage:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Download the .gz File: For each file URL in file_info, it sends a request to download the file. If the download is successful, it proceeds; otherwise, it skips to the next file.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Decompress the .gz Content: The downloaded content is opened in text mode ('rt') with UTF-8 encoding specified. Using gzip.open() with io.BytesIO() allows decompression directly in memory without saving the file locally. If thereâ€™s an error during decompression, it moves to the next file.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Upload to Azure Blob Storage: The decompressed CSV data (stored as plain text) is then uploaded to Azure Blob Storage with a specified blob_name using the Azure Blob client. If an error occurs during upload, the code logs it and proceeds with the next file.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Finally, after all files are processed, it prints a message indicating completion. This setup efficiently handles multiple files, using in-memory processing and error handling for each step.

# COMMAND ----------

# Process each URL and upload the decompressed CSV to Azure Blob Storage

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to decompress {blob_name}: {e}")
        continue
